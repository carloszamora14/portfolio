          The Daily UI Challenge is an initiative by Hype4 Academy aimed at the
          UI design community to encourage competition and help designers
          improve their skills through daily UI exercises. I participated in
          this 90-day challenge by creating and sharing a design each day that
          met the provided description and goals.

          Over the course of three months, the experience was both fun and
          unpredictable, as each day&apos;s challenge introduced a new and
          diverse design task. The topics varied widely, including designs like
          a smartwatch sleep-tracking interface, an alarm clock app, an FM radio
          screen, a sound recorder, a calculator, a credit card payment screen,
          a smart fridge UI, and a TV interface for a movie streaming app.

          I frequently conducted research, looking for references, inspiration,
          and color palettes to develop my own design solutions. On average, I
          spent around 2 hours daily on this project, and I&apos;m glad I didâ€”it
          greatly enhanced my design skills. I gained a deeper understanding of
          core principles such as spacing, alignment, typography hierarchy, and
          contrast. Additionally, I developed proficiency in Figma, as all of my
          designs were created using this tool.
